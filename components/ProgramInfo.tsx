                    This is the heart of the app, where users can access a personal
                    collection of recipes. It's designed with a user-friendly interface showcasing
                    recipes in a grid or list format. Each recipe is displayed with a thumbnail image,
                    title, and brief description. When a recipe is selected, it opens to reveal detailed
                    information including ingredients, step-by-step instructions, cooking time, and
                    nutritional facts. Users can easily add new recipes, edit existing ones, or delete them.
                    This page also offers a search bar and filter options to sort recipes by cuisine,
                    dietary restrictions, or ingredients.

                    "Desserts," and also provides a trending section based on whatâ€™s popular
                    among the app's community. Users can browse, search, and filter recipes
                    based on their preferences. Selecting a recipe offers the option to save
